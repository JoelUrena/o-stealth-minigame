change rotation x to -12.668

waste land of cool code

I was trying to make the bullet follow the mouse. didnt work

all i had to do was set z axis but vector 3 uses x y z maybe if i set x and y zero, it would work?
   // if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Mouse0))
       // {
       //     GetComponent<Transform>().Translate(ray); 
       //    
       // }
        Ray ray;
        RaycastHit hit;
        ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
        if (Physics.Raycast(ray , out hit , 100f))
            {
            move = hit.point;
        }

        GetComponent<Transform>.Translate(move);
